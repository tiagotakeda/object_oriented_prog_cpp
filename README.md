# Object Oriented Programming

## Mission

This guide was developed to help members from Skyrats - Autonomous Drones Team from Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo - to understand the concepts of object oriented programming in C++.

It assumes that the preson who is reading this is already used to programming in C++. If ythis is not your case, please check out the other tutorial about <a href="https://github.com/SkyRats/cpp_workshop">C++ Basic Concepts</a> before following this one.

Since it is a routine for the members to be asked to install Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) when they enter the team, some instructions are given to be inserted on a Linux Terminal.

If that may be an issue, you can easily follow this guide using an IDE (Codeblocks is a good starting IDE).

## Prerequisites

* Abstract Classes and Multiple Inheritance
* Defensive Programming
* Data Persistence
* Namespace, Templates and Standard Libraries

## Definition and Paradigms

Developing software does not envolve only a programming language itself, a good aspect to consider when developing anything is the programming paradigm, or the "way" of programming. 

To be more precise Timothy Budd describes it as "... way of conceptualizing what ist means to preform copmutation, of structuring and organizing how tasks are to be carried out on a computer." in his seminal <a href="https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Multiparadigm_Programming_in_Leda.html?id=qqxQAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y">book</a> on multiparadigm programming.

Each language has one or more paradigms. Some examples of paradigms and respective languages:

* Imperative: Pascal and Cobol
* Functional: Lisp, Haskel and Scala
* Logic: Prolog and Datalog
* **Object-Oriented: C++, C#, Java and Python**
* Event-Driven: used mostly in graphcal interfaces
* Declarative: SQL and HTML

In this way, Object Oriented Programming differs from others paradigms because it includes both data and functions. In addition, we are able to create relationships between one object and another.

## Concepts

## Reference

The reference to this guide is mostly based on a discipline (PCS3111 - Laboratório de Programação Orientada à Objetos para Engenharia Elétrica) given by the **Computer Engineering and Digital Systems Department (PCS)** from **Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo** to Electrical Enginerring Students on their second semester. 

The complete material is available, in Portuguese, in this repository.
