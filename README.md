# Object Oriented Programming

## Mission

This guide was developed to help members from Skyrats - Autonomous Drones Team from Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo - to understand the concepts of object oriented programming in C++.

It assumes that the preson who is reading this is already used to programming in C++. If ythis is not your case, please check out the other tutorial about <a href="https://github.com/SkyRats/cpp_workshop">C++ Basic Concepts</a> before following this one.

Since it is a routine for the members to be asked to install Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) when they enter the team, some instructions are given to be inserted on a Linux Terminal.

If that may be an issue, you can easily follow this guide using an IDE (Codeblocks is a good starting IDE).

## Prerequisites

  * GCC (Linux)

  * MinGW (Windows)

## Contents

* Definition and Paradigms
* Concepts
* Encapsulation
* Constructors and Destructors
* Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Reference

The reference to this guide is mostly based on a discipline (PCS3111 - Laboratório de Programação Orientada à Objetos para Engenharia Elétrica) given by the **Computer Engineering and Digital Systems Department (PCS)** from **Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo** to Electrical Enginerring Students on their second semester. 

The complete material is available, in Portuguese, in this repository.
