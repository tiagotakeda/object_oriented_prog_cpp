# Object Oriented Programming

### Mission

This guide was developed to help members from Skyrats - Autonomous Drones Team from Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo - to understand the concepts of object oriented programming in C++.

It assumes that the preson who is reading this is already used to programming in C++. If ythis is not your case, please check out the other tutorial about <a href="https://github.com/SkyRats/cpp_workshop">C++ Basic Concepts</a> before following this one.

Since it is a routine for the members to be asked to install Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) when they enter the team, some instructions are given to be inserted on a Linux Terminal.

If that may be an issue, you can easily follow this guide using an IDE (Codeblocks is a good starting IDE).
